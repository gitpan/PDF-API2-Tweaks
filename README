PDF-API2-Tweaks

PDF::API2::Tweaks provides a number of extensions to PDF::API2.

Most of the extensions deal with producing PDF overlays, to fill in
forms. For example,

    # Open an existing PDF file
    my $pdf = PDF::API2->open($form);

    # Retrieve an existing page
    my $page = $pdf->openpage(1);

    # Add a built-in font to the PDF
    my $font = $pdf->corefont('Helvetica');

    # Add some text to the page
    my $text = $page->text();
    $text->font($font, 10);
    $text->fillcolor('#000000');
    $text->strokecolor('#000000');

    # This is all basic PDF::API2. The following Tweaks extension will
    # produce a series of lines, the first one starting at position
    # 100,714 and subsequent lines spaced 16 apart:
    $text->textlist( 100, 714, 16, <<'EOD' );
    Now is the time
    for all good man
    to start using Perl
    EOD
